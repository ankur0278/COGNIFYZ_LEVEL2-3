# COGNIFYZ_LEVEL2-3
- This repository contains the code and insights for \Level 2 and Level 3 tasks completed during the Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.

# LEVEL 2

# Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Calculated the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- Compared average ratings of restaurants with and without table booking.
- Analyzed online delivery availability across different price ranges.

# Task 2: Price Range Analysis
- Identified the most common price range among restaurants.
- Calculated average ratings for each price range.
- Determined which rating color corresponds to the highest-rated price range.

# Task 3: Feature Engineering
- Created new features like:
- Length of restaurant name and address.
- Binary encoding of table booking and online delivery.
- Prepared the dataset for machine learning.

# LEVEL 3

# Task 1: Predictive Modeling
